<p>A half millennium ago, the Black Death tore through Europe, Africa, and Asia, taking millions of lives with it. Though it was so long ago, its effects have rippled through 500 years of history in many forms. Even given how important this virus was and is, most nobody knows the full story of it.</p>
<p> It started somewhere in China, with the first outbreaks there being recorded a decade or two before it ravaged Europe. It was passed across Asia via trade routes like the Silk Road. This major trade route linked things like the silk, paper and spices in India and China with the metals of Europe.</p>
<p> Mongol Khan Jani Beg’s army was brought to shambles by this disease in 1346/7 (sources debate the year), so in Crimea, he executed a plan. He loaded up carcasses of soldiers infected with the disease onto slingshots and shot them into towns to infect the locals. Ships from Crimea left westwards into the Mediterranean, and unknowingly carried the plague with them in the form of rats. While it might have seemed like a clever tactic back then, his decision would change Europe and Africa for years.</p>
<p> Ship after ship passed the disease on, spreading as far as Sicily, or even to the port city of Marseille in southern France. While it spread through Italy, quarantine was introduced. Meanwhile, it also extended into Greece via Constantinople. Marseille was a major spreading hub for the plague, which helped infect Western Europe’s Mediterranean coasts.</p>

<p> 1348 was probably the biggest year for the plague, with the city of Marseille helping spread it all across Western Europe, and even into the United Kingdom (with the help of it travelling overland to Bordeaux, then to the UK). Meanwhile, with the multiple fronts from Sicily and Constantinople, to name a few, basically all of Southern Europe and parts of North Africa were infected.</p>
<p> Cairo saw 200,000 deaths in the year, and Alexandria had nearly a death a minute, most of those undoubtedly from the plague. While 1348 lead to the Black Death being spread basically everywhere, 1349 had it taking up the nooks and crannies. Ships arrived in Oslo to spread the virus, it pushed forward to cover England, Wales and Ireland, Iberia was fully conquered by it – not to mention how Central Europe was engulfed by the plague in this year. Germany, Hungary – you name it, and it most likely had an outbreak that year.</p>
<p> 1350 was a “slow” year for the plague. Mostly, it spread through northern Europe, into the northern regions of Germany and into Denmark and Sweden-Norway. In this year the plague also hit the north end of the UK, and on its way there killed a million and a half – nearly forty percent of the population.</p>
<p> In 1351, the disease entered into the modern-day Russian Empire, via the city state of Novgorod, and while it was slowed by the winter, it released its full force in 1352. Poland, which had held off the Black Death for some time, fell around 1351-52. Finally, Moscow was ravaged in 1353 – the last major place to be infected.</p>
<p> Anywhere from 25,000,000 to a mind-boggling 50,000,000 people in Europe alone died, with around that much in China as well. The only places where we’re certain that this horrible virus didn’t reach are Iceland, due to its remoteness and distance from the mainland, and Finland, due its sparseness.</p>
<hr>
<p> Europe’s reaction to the plague was a severe one. Many Christians believed that the plague was a punishment from God for tolerating Jews, so they whipped themselves in repentance, while some even murdered Jews. Meanwhile, the Muslims generally believed that the Black Death was a divine act and that they couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
<p> It shan't be said, but it was most definitely appalling to live at the time. People infected were covered with buboes, which are sickly, garish boils that invaded many bodies of the era. In the first weeks of infection, one would also see repulsive vomiting, splitting headaches and maniacal delirium.</p>
<p> What worsenes it is that the abhorrent people of the day had no sense of hygiene – sneezing and coughing willy-nilly, unknowingly giving their entire village the lethal plague. Luckily, quarantine and other safety measures were introduced to slow down the horrid plague.</p>
<p> It has been very eye opening to look back at the Black Death five hundred years later. While it was a horrific tragedy, the Black Death indirectly gave us many things of the modern day, such as improved healthcare, the fall of the fuedal hierarchy, and might have even introduced the wonderful paintings of the Renaissance. Adieu and farewell.
